shameless retro rip

todo:
* pixel perfect collisions
* ship construction via map, dynamic damage tracking? 
* = tiles have damaged and destroyed states with impact on gameplay
* = different backgrounds for player and enemy
* bottom map layers as actual game map
* gun turrets rotate and aiming lines
* ammo modules affect ammo replenishment, guns have ammo capacity
* no special ammo but special guns
*
